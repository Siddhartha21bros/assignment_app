        <p className="hero__lines">Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.<br></br>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word ‚Äúand‚Äù and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn‚Äôt take long until a few insidious <strong>Copy Writers</strong>  ambushed her,</li>
            <li>Made her drunk with <strong>Longe </strong>and <strong>Parole </strong>and dragged her into their agency.</li>
            <li>Where they abused her for their projects again and again.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="hero__lines">And if she hasn‚Äôt been rewritten, then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.</p>
